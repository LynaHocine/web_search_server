# Project PAI2D - HARMONI as a Model Context Protocol tool 

Our goal in this project is to implement an integration between HARMONI (codebase available at https://github.com/hamedR96/HARMONI) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This integration aims to make HARMONI accessible as a standardized context provider, enabling foundation models to reason over audio, visual, and long-term user memory in unified manner. 

We seek to position HARMONI as a general-purpose multimodal interface layer that allows language and vision language models to operate robustly in real-world, multi-user interactive environments.

## Prerequisites 

- **Python 3.11 or 3.12**
- **Ollama** installed and running locally https://ollama.com/
- **SerpAPI key** to get from https://serpapi.com/

## Installation 

1. Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LynaHocine/HARMONI_as_MCP_tool.git
cd HARMONI_as_MCP_tool
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended: Python 3.11 or 3.12)
- On Linux/macOS:
```bash
    python 3.12 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```bash
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install langchain-ollama langchain-mcp-adapters langgraph mcp fastmcp serpapi python-dotenv SpeechRecognition requests
```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root folder:
```
SERPAPI_KEY=your_key

```

## Execution 
```bash
cd agent
python agent.py
```

The server starts automatically. You can then ask your question:
