# Project PAI2D - HARMONI as a Model Context Protocol tool 

Our goal in this project is to implement an integration between HARMONI (codebase available at https://github.com/hamedR96/HARMONI) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This integration aims to make HARMONI accessible as a standardized context provider, enabling foundation models to reason over audio, visual, and long-term user memory in unified manner. 

We seek to position HARMONI as a general-purpose multimodal interface layer that allows language and vision language models to operate robustly in real-world, multi-user interactive environments.
